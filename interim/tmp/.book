In the foreground, against the right-hand wall, is a stove decorated with sprigs of fresh birch and wild flowers. Farther back, a door. In the back wall folding doors leading into the entrance hall. In the left-hand wall a window, in front of which is a stand filled with flowers and plants. Near the stove stand a table, a couch and an easy-chair. The walls are hung round with portraits, dating from various periods, of clergymen, military officers and other officials in uniform. The window is open, and so are the doors into the lobby and the outer door. Through the latter is seen an avenue of old trees leading to a courtyard. It is a summer evening, after sunset.

Isn't there a draught where you are sitting, miss?</p><p>Rebecca. There is a little. Will you shut up, please? (MRS. HELSETH goes to the hall door and shuts it. Then she goes to the window, to shut it, and looks out.)</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Isn't that Mr. Rosmer coming there?</p><p>Rebecca. Where? (Gets up. Yes, it is he. (Stands behind the window-curtain.)

(Peeps out between the curtain and the window-frame). Now we shall see whether—</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Is he going over the wooden bridge?</p><p>Rebecca. That is just what I want to see. (After a moment. No. He has turned aside. He is coming the other way round to-day too. (Comes away from the window.) It is a long way round.)</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Yes, of course. One can well understand his shrinking from going over that bridge. The spot where such a thing has happened is—</p><p>Rebecca (folding up her work). They cling to their dead a long time at Rosmersholm.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. If you ask me, miss, I should say it is the dead that cling to Rosmersholm a long time.</p><p>Rebecca (looking at her).

  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">don't seem to be able to tear themselves away from those they have left behind.</p><p>Rebecca. What puts that idea into your head?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Well, otherwise I know the White Horses would not be seen here.</p><p>Rebecca. Tell me, Mrs. Helseth—what is this superstition about the White Horses?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Oh, it is not worth talking about. I am sure you don't believe in such things, either.</p><p>Rebecca. Do you believe in them?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth (goes to the window and shuts it). Oh, I am not going to give you a chance of laughing at me, miss. (Looks out. See—is that not Mr. Rosmer out on the mill path again?)</p><p>Rebecca (looking out). That man out there? (Goes to the window. Why, that is Mr. Kroll, of course!)</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. So it is, to be sure.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. That is delightful, because he is certain to</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">be coming here.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. He actually comes straight over the wooden bridge, he does for all that she was his own sister. Well, I will go in and get the supper laid, miss. (Goes out to the right. REBECCA stands still for a moment, then waves her hand out of the window, nodding and smiling. Darkness is beginning to fall.)</p><p>Rebecca (going to the door on the right and calling through it). Mrs. Helseth, I am sure you won't mind preparing something extra nice for supper? You know what dishes Mr. Kroll is especially fond of.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Certainly, miss. I will.</p><p>Rebecca (opening the door into the lobby). At last, Mr. Kroll! I am so glad to see you!</p><p>Kroll (coming into the lobby and putting down his stick). Thank you. Are you sure I am not disturbing you?</p><p>Rebecca. You? How can you say such a thing?</p>",
  "page-15": "<p>Kroll (coming into the room). You are always so kind. (Looks round the room. Is John up in his room?)</p><p>Rebecca. No, he has gone out for a walk. He is later than usual of coming in, but he is sure to be back directly. (Points to the sofa. Do sit down and wait for him.)</p><p>Kroll (putting down his hat). Thank you. (Sits down and looks about him. How charmingly pretty you have made the old room look! Flowers everywhere!)</p><p>Rebecca. Mr. Rosmer is so fond of having fresh flowers about him.</p><p>Kroll. And so are you, I should say.</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, I am. I think their scent has such a delicious effect on one—and till lately we had to deny ourselves that pleasure, you know.</p><p>Kroll (nodding slowly). Poor Beata could not stand the scent of them.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. Nor their colours either. They made her</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">feel dazed.</p><p>Kroll. Yes, I remember. (Continues in a more cheerful tone of voice). Well, and how are things going here?</p><p>Rebecca. Oh, everything goes on in the same quiet, placid way. One day is exactly like another. And how are things with you? Is your wife—?</p><p>Kroll. Oh, my dear Miss West, don't let us talk about my affairs. In a family there is always something or other going awry—especially in such times as we live in now.</p><p>Rebecca (after a short pause, sitting down in an easy-chair near the sofa). Why have you never once been near us during the whole of your holidays?</p><p>Kroll. Oh, it doesn't do to be importunate, you know.</p><p>Rebecca. If you only knew how we have missed you.</p><p>Kroll. And, besides, I have been away, you know.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. Yes, for a fortnight or so. I suppose you</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">have been going the round of the public meetings?</p><p>Kroll (nods). Yes, what do you say to that? Would you ever have thought I would become a political agitator in my old age—eh?</p><p>Rebecca (smilingly). You have always been a little bit of an agitator, Mr. Kroll.</p><p>Kroll. Oh, yes; just for my own amusement. But for the future it is going to be in real earnest. Do you ever read the Radical newspapers?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, I won't deny that!</p><p>Kroll. My dear Miss West, there is no objection to that—not as far as you are concerned.</p><p>Rebecca. No, that is just what I think. I must follow the course of events—keep up with what is happening.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Well, under any circumstances, I should never expect you, as a woman, to side actively with either party in the civic dispute—indeed one might more properly call it the civil war—that is raging here. I dare</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">say you have read, then, the abuse these \"nature's gentlemen\" are pleased to shower upon me, and the scandalous coarseness they consider they are entitled to make use of?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, but I think you have held your own pretty forcibly.</p><p>Kroll. That I have—though I say it. I have tasted blood now, and I will make them realise that I am not the sort of man to take it lying down—. (Checks himself. No, no, do not let us get upon that sad and distressing topic this evening.)</p><p>Rebecca. No, my dear Mr. Kroll, certainly not.</p><p>Kroll. Tell me, instead, how you find you get on at Rosmersholm, now that you are alone here—I mean, since our poor Beata—</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. Oh, thanks—I get on very well here. Her death has made a great gap in the house in many ways, of course—and one misses her and grieves for her,</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">naturally. But in other respects—</p><p>Kroll. Do you think you will remain here?—permanently, I mean?</p><p>Rebecca. Dear Mr. Kroll, I really never think about it at all. The fact is that I have become so thoroughly domesticated here that I almost feel as if I belonged to the place too.</p><p>Kroll. You? I should think you did!</p><p>Rebecca. And as long as Mr. Rosmer finds I can be any comfort or any use to him, I will gladly remain here, undoubtedly.</p><p>Kroll (looking at her, with some emotion). You know, there is something splendid about a woman's sacrificing the whole of her youth for others.</p><p>Rebecca. What else have I had to live for?</p><p>Kroll. At first when you came here there was your perpetual worry with that unreasonable cripple of a foster-father of yours—</p>",
  "page-20": "<p>Rebecca. You mustn't think that Dr. West was as unreasonable as that when we lived in Finmark. It was the trying journeys by sea that broke him up. But it is quite true that after we had moved here there were one or two hard years before his sufferings were over.</p><p>Kroll. Were not the years that followed even harder for you?</p><p>Rebecca. No; how can you say such a thing! I, who was so genuinely fond of Beata—! And she, poor soul was so sadly in need of care and sympathetic companionship.</p><p>Kroll. You deserve to be thanked and rewarded for the forbearance with which you speak of her.</p><p>Rebecca (moving a little nearer to him). Dear Mr. Kroll, you say that so kindly and so sincerely that I feel sure you really bear me no ill-will.</p><p>Kroll. Ill-will? What do you mean?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. Well, it would not be so very surprising if it</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">were rather painful for you to see me, a stranger, doing just as I like here at Rosmersholm.</p><p>Kroll. How in the world could you think—!</p><p>Rebecca. Then it is not so? (Holds out her hand to, him. Thank you, Mr. Kroll; thank you for that.)</p><p>Kroll. But what on earth could make you take such an idea into your head?</p><p>Rebecca. I began to be afraid it might be so, as you have so seldom been out here to see us lately.</p><p>Kroll. I can assure you, you have been on the wrong scent entirely, Miss West. And, in any case, the situation of affairs is unchanged in any essential point; because during the last sad years of poor Beata's life it was you and you alone, even then, that looked after everything here.</p><p>Rebecca. But it was more like a kind of regency in the wife's name.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Whatever it was, I—. I will tell you what, Miss</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">West; as far as I am concerned I should have nothing whatever to say against it if you. But it doesn't do to say such things.</p><p>Rebecca. What things?</p><p>Kroll. Well, if it so happened that you were to step into the empty place—</p><p>Rebecca. I have the place I want, already, Mr. Kroll.</p><p>Kroll. Yes, as far as material benefits go; but not—</p><p>Rebecca (interrupting him, in a serious voice). For shame, Mr. Kroll! How can you sit there and jest about such things!</p><p>Kroll. Oh, well, I dare say our good John Rosmer thinks he has had more than enough of married life. But, all the same—</p><p>Rebecca. Really, you almost make me feel inclined to laugh at you.</p><p>Kroll. All the same—Tell me, Miss West, if I may be allowed the question, how old are you?</p>",
  "page-23": "<p>Rebecca. I am ashamed to say I was twenty-nine on my last birthday, Mr. Kroll. I am nearly thirty.</p><p>Kroll. Quite so. And Rosmer—how old is he? Let me see. He is five years younger than me, so he must be just about forty-three. It seems to me it would be very suitable.</p><p>Rebecca. No doubt, no doubt. It would be remarkably suitable—Will you stop and have supper with us?</p><p>Kroll. Thank you. I had meant to pay you a good long visit, because there is a matter I want to talk over with our excellent friend—Well, then, Miss West, to prevent your taking foolish ideas into your head again, I will come out here again from time to time, as in the old days.</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, please do. (Holds out her hand to, him. Thank you, thank you! You are really uncommonly good-natured.)</p>",
  "page-24": "<p>Kroll (with a little grumble). Am I? I can tell you that is more than they say at home. (ROSMER comes in by the door on the right.)</p><p>Rebecca. Mr. Rosmer, do you see who is sitting here?</p><p>Rosmer. Mrs. Helseth told me. (KROLL gets up. I am so glad to see you here again, my dear fellow. (Puts his hands on KROLL'S shoulders and looks him in the face.) Dear old friend! I knew that one day we should be on our old footing again.)</p><p>Kroll. My dear fellow, have you that insane idea in your head too, that any thing could come between us?</p><p>Rebecca (to ROSMER). Isn't it delightful to think it was all our imagination!</p><p>Rosmer. Is that really true, Kroll? But why have you kept so obstinately away from us?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll (seriously, and in, a subdued voice). Because I did not want to come here like a living reminder of the</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">unhappy time that is past—and of her who met her death in the mill-race.</p><p>Rosmer. It was a very kind thought on your part. You are always so considerate. But it was altogether unnecessary to keep away from us on that account. Come along, let us sit down on the sofa. (They sit down. I can assure you it is not in the least painful for me to think about Beata. We talk about her every day. She seems to us to have a part in the house still.)</p><p>Kroll. Does she really?</p><p>Rebecca (lighting the lamp). Yes, it is really quite true.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. She really does. We both think so affectionately of her. And both Rebecca—both Miss West and I know in our hearts that we did all that lay in our power for the poor afflicted creature. We have nothing to reproach ourselves with. That is why I feel there is something sweet and peaceful in the way we can</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">think of Beata now.</p><p>Kroll. You dear good people! In future I am coming out to see you every day.</p><p>Rebecca (sitting down in an arm-chair). Yes, let us see that you keep your word.</p><p>Rosmer (with a slight hesitation). I assure you, my dear fellow, my dearest wish would be that our intimacy should never suffer in any way. You know, you have seemed to be my natural adviser as long as we have known one another, even from my student days.</p><p>Kroll. I know, and I am very proud of the privilege. Is there by any chance anything in particular just now—?</p><p>Rosmer. There are a great many things that I want very much to talk over with you frankly—things that lie very near my heart.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. I feel that is so, too, Mr. Rosmer. It seems to me it would be such a good thing if you two old</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">friends—</p><p>Kroll. Well, I can assure you I have even more to talk over with you—because I have become an active politician, as I dare say you know.</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, I know you have. How did that come about?</p><p>Kroll. I had to, you see, whether I liked it or not. It became impossible for me to remain an idle spectator any longer. Now that the Radicals have become so distressingly powerful, it was high time. And that is also why I have induced our little circle of friends in the town to bind themselves more definitely together. It was high time, I can tell you!</p><p>Rebecca (with a slight smile). As a matter of fact, isn't it really rather late now?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. There is no denying it would have been more fortunate if we had succeeded in checking the stream at an earlier point. But who could really foresee what was</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">coming? I am sure I could not. (Gets up and walks up and down. Anyway, my eyes are completely opened now; for the spirit of revolt has spread even into my school.)</p><p>Rosmer. Into the school? Surely not into your school?</p><p>Kroll. Indeed it has. Into my own school. What do you think of this? I have got wind of the fact that the boys in the top class—or rather, a part of the boys in it—have formed themselves into a secret society and have been taking in Mortensgaard's paper!</p><p>Rebecca. Ah, the \"Searchlight\".</p><p>Kroll. Yes, don't you think that is a nice sort of intellectual pabulum for future public servants? But the saddest part of it is that it is all the most promising boys in the class that have conspired together and hatched this plot against me. It is only the duffers and dunces that have held aloof from it.</p>",
  "page-29": "<p>Rebecca. Do you take it so much to heart, Mr. Kroll?</p><p>Kroll. Do I take it to heart, to find myself so hampered and thwarted in my life's work? (Speaking more gently. I might find it in my heart to say that I could even take that for what it is worth; but I have not told you the worst of it yet. (Looks round the room.) I suppose nobody is likely to be listening at the doors?)</p><p>Rebecca. Oh, certainly not.</p><p>Kroll. Then let me tell you that the revolt and dissension has spread into my own home—into my own peaceful home—and has disturbed the peace of my family life.</p><p>Rosmer (getting up). Do you mean it? In your own home?</p><p>Rebecca (going up to Kroll). Dear Mr. Kroll, what has happened?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Would you believe it that my own children—.</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">To make a long story short, my boy Laurits is the moving spirit of the conspiracy at the school. And Hilda has embroidered a red portfolio to keep the numbers of the \"Searchlight\" in.</p><p>Rosmer. I should never have dreamed of such a thing; in your family—in your own house!</p><p>Kroll. No, who would ever have dreamed of such a thing? In my house, where obedience and order have always ruled—where hitherto there has never been anything but one unanimous will—</p><p>Rebecca. How does your wife take it?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Ah, that is the most incredible part of the whole thing. She, who all her days—in great things and small—has concurred in my opinions and approved of all my views, has actually not refrained from throwing her weight on the children's side on many points. And now she considers I am to blame for what has happened. She says I try to coerce the young people too</p>",
  "page-31": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">much. Just as if it were not necessary to—. Well, those are the sort of dissensions I have going on at home. But naturally I talk as little about it as possible; it is better to be silent about such things. (Walks across the floor. Oh, yes.—Oh, yes. (Stands by the window, with his hands behind his back, and looks out.))</p><p>Rebecca (goes up to ROSMER, and speaks in low, hurried tones, unheard by KROLL). Do it!</p><p>Rosmer (in the same tone). Not to-night.</p><p>Rebecca (as before). Yes, this night of all others. (Goes away from him and adjusts the lamp.)</p><p>Kroll (coming back). Yes, my dear John, so now you know the sort of spirit of the age that has cast its shadow both over my home life and my official work. Ought I not to oppose this appalling, destructive, disorganising tendency with all the weapons I can lay my hands upon? Of course it is certainly my duty—and that both with my pen and my tongue.</p>",
  "page-32": "<p>Rosmer. But have you any hope that you can produce any effect in that way?</p><p>Kroll. At all events I mean to take my share in the fight as a citizen. And I consider that it is the duty of every patriotic man, every man who is concerned about what is right, to do the same. And, I may as well tell you, that is really the reason why I have come here to see you to-night.</p><p>Rosmer. My dear fellow, what do you mean? What can I—?</p><p>Kroll. You are going to help your old friends, and do as we are doing—take your share in it to the best of your ability.</p><p>Rebecca. But, Mr. Kroll, you know how little taste Mr. Rosmer has for that sort of thing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Then he has got to overcome that distaste now. You do not keep abreast of the times, John. You sit here and bury yourself in your historical researches.</p>",
  "page-33": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Goodness knows, I have the greatest respect for family pedigrees and all that they imply. But this is not the time for such occupations, unhappily. You have no conception of the state of affairs that is going on all over the country. Every single idea is turned upside down, or very nearly so. It will be a hard fight to get all the errors straightened out again.</p><p>Rosmer. I can quite believe it. But that sort of a fight is not in my line at all.</p><p>Rebecca. Besides, I rather fancy that Mr. Rosmer has come to look at the affairs of life with wider opened eyes than before.</p><p>Kroll (with a start). Wider opened eyes?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, or with an opener mind—with less prejudice.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. What do you mean by that? John—surely you could never be so weak as to allow yourself to be deluded by the accidental circumstance that the</p>",
  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">demagogues have scored a temporary success!</p><p>Rosmer. My dear fellow, you know very well that I am no judge of politics; but it certainly seems to me that of late years individual thought has become somewhat more independent.</p><p>Kroll. Quite so—but do you consider that as a matter of course to be a good thing? In any case you are vastly mistaken, my friend. Just inquire a little into the opinions that are current amongst the Radicals, both out here in the country and in town. You will find them to be nothing else than the words of wisdom that appear in the \"Searchlight\".</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, Mortensgaard has a great deal of influence over the people about here.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Yes, just think of it—a man with as dirty a record as his! A fellow that was turned out of his place as a schoolmaster because of his immoral conduct! This is the sort of man that poses as a leader of the people!</p>",
  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">And successfully, too!—actually successfully! I hear that he means to enlarge his paper now. I know, on reliable authority, that he is looking for a competent assistant.</p><p>Rebecca. It seems to me surprising that you and your friends do not start an opposition paper.</p><p>Kroll. That is exactly what we intend to do. This very day we have bought the \"County News.\" There was no difficulty about the financial side of the matter; but— (Turns towards ROSMER Now we have come to the real purport of my visit. It is the Management of it—the editorial management—that is the difficulty, you see. Look here, Rosmer—don't you feel called upon to undertake it, for the sake of the good cause?)</p><p>Rosmer (in a tone of consternation). I!</p><p>Rebecca. How can you think of such a thing!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. I can quite understand your having a horror of public meetings and being unwilling to expose yourself to the mercies of the rabble that frequents</p>",
  "page-36": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">them. But an editor's work, which is carried on in much greater privacy, or rather—</p><p>Rosmer. No, no, my dear fellow, you must not ask that of me.</p><p>Kroll. It would give me the greatest pleasure to have a try at work of that sort myself—only it would be quite out of the question for me; I am already saddled with such an endless number of duties. You, on the other hand, who are no longer hampered by any official duties, might—. Of course the rest of us would give you all the help in our power.</p><p>Rosmer. I cannot do it, Kroll. I am not fitted for it.</p><p>Kroll. Not fitted for it? That was just what you said when your father got you your living.</p><p>Rosmer. I was quite right; and that was why I resigned it, too.</p><p>Kroll. Well, if you only make as good an editor as you did a parson, we shall be quite satisfied.</p>",
  "page-37": "<p>Rosmer. My dear Kroll—once for all—I cannot do it.</p><p>Kroll. Well, then, I suppose you will give us the use of your name, at all events?</p><p>Rosmer. My name?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Yes, the mere fact of John Rosmer's name being connected with it will be a great advantage to the paper. We others are looked upon as pronounced partisans. I myself even have the reputation of being a wicked fanatic, I am told. Therefore we cannot count upon our own names to give us any particular help in making the paper known to the misguided masses. But you, on the contrary, have always held aloof from this kind of fighting. Your gentle and upright disposition, your polished mind, your unimpeachable honour, are known to and appreciated by every one about here. And then there is the deference and respect that your former position as a clergyman ensures for you—and,</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">besides that, there is the veneration in which your family, name is held!</p><p>Rosmer. Oh, my family name.</p><p>Kroll (pointing to the portraits). Rosmers of Rosmersholm—clergymen, soldiers, men who have filled high places in the state—men of scrupulous honour, every one of them—a family that has been rooted here, the most influential in the place, for nearly two centuries. (Lays his hand on ROSMER'S shoulder. John, you owe it to yourself and to the traditions of your race to join us in defence of all that has hitherto been held sacred in our community. (Turning to REBECCA.) What do you say, Miss West?)</p><p>Rebecca (with a quiet little laugh). my dear Mr. Kroll—it all sounds so absurdly ludicrous to me.</p><p>Kroll. What! Ludicrous?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, because it is time you were told plainly—</p>",
  "page-39": "<p>Rosmer (hurriedly). No, no—don't! Not now!</p><p>Kroll (looking from one to the other). But, my dear friends, what on earth—? (Breaks off, as MRS.

Well, ask him to come in.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Shall I show him in here, sir?</p><p>Rosmer. Certainly.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. But he doesn't look the sort of man one ought to allow in here.</p><p>Rebecca. What does he look like, Mrs. Helseth?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Oh, he is not much to look at, Miss.</p><p>Rosmer. Did he not give you his name?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Yes, I think he said it was Hekman, or something like that.</p><p>Rosmer. I do not know any one of that name.</p>",
  "page-40": "<p>Mrs. Helseth. And he said his Christian name was Ulrik.</p><p>Rosmer (with a start of surprise). Ulrik Hetman! Was that it?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Yes, sir, it was Hetman.</p><p>Kroll. I am certain I have heard that name before.</p><p>Rebecca. Surely it was the name that strange creature used to write under—</p><p>Rosmer (to Kroll).

You have been thinking things over—</p><p>Kroll. You misunderstand me altogether. (Puts his hat down on the table. It is important that I should speak to you alone.)</p><p>Rosmer. Why may not Miss West—?</p><p>Rebecca. No, no, Mr. Rosmer. I will go.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll (looking meaningly at her). And I see I ought to apologise to you, Miss West, for coming here so early</p>",
  "page-74": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in the morning. I see I have taken you by surprise, before you have had time to—</p><p>Rebecca (with a start). Why so? Do you find anything out of place in the fact of my wearing a morning wrapper at home here?</p><p>Kroll. By no means! Besides, I have no knowledge of what customs may have grown up at Rosmersholm.</p><p>Rosmer. Kroll, you are not the least like yourself to-day.</p><p>Rebecca. I will wish you good morning, Mr. Kroll. (Goes out to the left.)</p><p>Kroll. If. you will allow me— (Sits down on the couch.)</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, my dear fellow, let us make ourselves comfortable and have a confidential talk. (Sits down on a chair facing KROLL.)</p><p>Kroll. I have not been able to close an eye since yesterday. I lay all night, thinking and thinking.</p>",
  "page-75": "<p>Rosmer. And what have you got to say to-day?</p><p>Kroll. It will take me some time, Rosmer. Let me begin with a sort of introduction. I can give you some news of Ulrick Brendel.</p><p>Rosmer. Has he been to see you?</p><p>Kroll. No. He took up his quarters in a low-class tavern—in the lowest kind of company, of course; drank, and stood drinks to others, as long as he had any money left; and then began to abuse the whole lot of them as a contemptible rabble—and, indeed, as far as that goes he was quite right. But the result was, that he got a thrashing and was thrown out into the gutter.</p><p>Rosmer. I see he is altogether incorrigible.</p><p>Kroll. He had pawned the coat you gave him, too, but that is going to be redeemed for him. Can you guess by whom?</p><p>Rosmer. By yourself, perhaps?</p><p>Kroll. No. By our noble friend Mr. Mortensgaard.</p>",
  "page-76": "<p>Rosmer. Is that so?</p><p>Kroll. I am informed that Mr. Brendel's first visit was paid to the \"idiot\" and \"plebeian\".</p><p>Rosmer. Well, it was very lucky for him—</p><p>Kroll. Indeed it was. (Leans over the table, towards ROSMER. Now I am coming to a matter of which, for the sake of our old—our former—friendship, it is my duty to warn you.)</p><p>Rosmer. My dear fellow, what is that?</p><p>Kroll. It is this; that certain games are going on behind your back in this house.</p><p>Rosmer. How can you think that? Is it Rebec—is it Miss West you are alluding to?</p><p>Kroll. Precisely. And I can quite understand it on her part; she has been accustomed, for such a long time now, to do as she likes here. But nevertheless—</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. My dear Kroll, you are absolutely mistaken. She and I have no secrets from one another about</p>",
  "page-77": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">anything whatever.</p><p>Kroll. Then has she confessed to you that she has been corresponding with the editor of the \"Searchlight\"?</p><p>Rosmer. Oh, you mean the couple of lines she wrote to him on Ulrik Brendel's behalf?</p><p>Kroll. You have found that out, then? And do you approve of her being on terms of this sort with that scurrilous hack, who almost every week tries to pillory me for my attitude in my school and out of it?</p><p>Rosmer. My dear fellow, I don't suppose that side of the question has ever occurred to her. And in any case, of course she has entire freedom of action, just as I have myself.</p><p>Kroll. Indeed? Well, I suppose that is quite in accordance with the new turn your views have taken—because I suppose Miss West looks at things from the same standpoint as you?</p>",
  "page-78": "<p>Rosmer. She does. We two have worked our way forward in complete companionship.</p><p>Kroll (looking at him and shaking his head slowly). Oh, you blind, deluded man!</p><p>Rosmer. I? What makes you say that?</p><p>Kroll. Because I dare not—I WILL not—think the worst. No, no, let me finish what I want to say. Am I to believe that you really prize my friendship, Rosmer? And my respect, too? Do you?</p><p>Rosmer. Surely I need not answer that question.</p><p>Kroll. Well, but there are other things that require answering—that require full explanation on your part. Will you submit to it if I hold a sort of inquiry—?</p><p>Rosmer. An inquiry?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Yes, if I ask you questions about one or two things that it may be painful for you to recall to mind. For instance, the matter of your apostasy—well, your emancipation, if you choose to call it so—is bound up</p>",
  "page-79": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with so much else for which, for your own sake, you ought to account to me.</p><p>Rosmer. My dear fellow, ask me about anything you please. I have nothing to conceal.</p><p>Kroll. Well, then, tell me this—what do you yourself believe was the real reason of Beata's making away with herself?</p><p>Rosmer. Can you have any doubt? Or perhaps I should rather say, need one look for reasons for what an unhappy sick woman, who is unaccountable for her actions, may do?</p><p>Kroll. Are you certain that Beata was so entirely unaccountable for her actions? The doctors, at all events, did not consider that so absolutely certain.</p><p>Rosmer. If the doctors had ever seen her in the state in which I have so often seen her, both night and day, they would have had no doubt about it.</p><p>Kroll. I did not doubt it either, at the time.</p>",
  "page-80": "<p>Rosmer. Of course not. It was impossible to doubt it, unfortunately. You remember what I told you of her ungovernable, wild fits of passion—which she expected me to reciprocate. She terrified me! And think how she tortured herself with baseless self-reproaches in the last years of her life!</p><p>Kroll. Yes, when she knew that she would always be childless.</p><p>Rosmer. Well, think what it meant—to be perpetually in the clutches of such—agony of mind over a thing that she was not in the slightest degree responsible for—! Are you going to suggest that she was accountable for her actions?</p><p>Kroll. Hm!—Do you remember whether at that time you had, in the house any books dealing with the purport of marriage—according to the advanced views of to-day?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. I remember Miss West's lending me a work</p>",
  "page-81": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of the kind. She inherited Dr. West's library, you know. But, my dear Kroll, you surely do not suppose that we were so imprudent as to let the poor sick creature get wind of any such ideas? I can solemnly swear that we were in no way to blame. It was the overwrought nerves of her own brain that were responsible for these frantic aberrations.</p><p>Kroll. There is one thing, at any rate, that I can tell you now, and that is that your poor tortured and overwrought Beata put an end to her own life in order that yours might be happy—and that you might be free to live as you pleased.</p><p>Rosmer (starting half up from his chair). What do you mean by that?</p><p>Kroll. You must listen to me quietly, Rosmer—because now I can speak of it. During the last year of her life she came twice to see me, to tell me what she suffered from her fears and her despair.</p>",
  "page-82": "<p>Rosmer. On that point?</p><p>Kroll. No. The first time she came she declared that you were on the high road to apostasy—that you were going to desert the faith that your father had taught you.</p><p>Rosmer (eagerly). What you say is impossible, Kroll!—absolutely impossible! You must be wrong about that.</p><p>Kroll. Why?</p><p>Rosmer. Because as long as Beata lived I was still doubting and fighting with myself. And I fought out that fight alone and in the completest secrecy. I do not imagine that even Rebecca—</p><p>Kroll. Rebecca?</p><p>Rosmer. Oh, well—Miss West. I call her Rebecca for the sake of convenience.</p><p>Kroll. So I have observed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. That is why it is so incomprehensible to me</p>",
  "page-83": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that Beata should have had any suspicion of it. Why did she never speak to me about it?—for she never did, by a single word.</p><p>Kroll. Poor soul—she begged and implored me to speak to you.</p><p>Rosmer. Then why did you never do so?</p><p>Kroll. Do you think I had a moment's doubt, at that time, that her mind was unhinged? Such an accusation as that, against a man like you! Well, she came to see me again, about a month later. She seemed calmer then; but, as she was going away, she said: \"They may expect to see the White Horse soon at Rosmersholm.\"</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, I know—the White Horse. She often used to talk about that.</p><p>Kroll. And then, when I tried to distract her from such unhappy thoughts, she only answered: \"I have not much time left; for John must marry Rebecca immediately now.\"</p>",
  "page-84": "<p>Rosmer (almost speechless). What are you saying! I marry—!</p><p>Kroll. That was on a Thursday afternoon. On the Saturday evening she threw herself from the footbridge into the millrace.</p><p>Rosmer. And you never warned us!</p><p>Kroll. Well, you know yourself how constantly she used to say that she was sure she would die before long.</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, I know. But, all the same, you ought to have warned us!</p><p>Kroll. I did think of doing so. But then it was too late.</p><p>Rosmer. But since then, why have you not—? Why have you kept all this to yourself?</p><p>Kroll. What good would it have done for me to come here and add to your pain and distress? Of course I thought the whole thing was merely wild, empty fancy—until yesterday evening.</p>",
  "page-85": "<p>Rosmer. Then you do not think so any longer?</p><p>Kroll. Did not Beata see clearly enough, when she saw that you were going to fall away from your childhood's faith?</p><p>Rosmer (staring in front of him). Yes, I cannot understand that. It is the most incomprehensible thing in the world to me.</p><p>Kroll. Incomprehensible or not, the thing is true. And now I ask you, Rosmer, how much truth is there in her other accusation?—the last one, I mean.</p><p>Rosmer. Accusation? Was that an accusation, then?</p><p>Kroll. Perhaps you did not notice how it was worded. She said she meant to stand out of the way. Why? Well?</p><p>Rosmer. In order that I might marry Rebecca, apparently.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. That was not quite how it was worded. Beata expressed herself differently. She said \"I have not much</p>",
  "page-86": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">time left; for John must marry Rebecca IMMEDIATELY now.\"</p><p>Rosmer (looks at him for a moment; then gets up). Now I understand you, Kroll.</p><p>Kroll. And if you do? What answer have you to make?</p><p>Rosmer (in an even voice, controlling himself). To such an unheard-of—? The only fitting answer would be to point to the door.</p><p>Kroll (getting up). Very good.</p><p>Rosmer (standing face to face with him). Listen to me. For considerably more than a year to be precise, since Beata's death—Rebecca West and I have lived here alone at Rosmersholm. All that time you have known of the charge Beata made against us; but I have never for one moment seen you appear the least scandalised at our living together here.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. I never knew, till yesterday evening, that it was</p>",
  "page-87": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a case of an apostate man and an \"emancipated\" woman living together.</p><p>Rosmer. Ah! So then you do not believe in any purity of life among apostates or emancipated folk? You do not believe that they may have the instinct of morality ingrained in their natures?</p><p>Kroll. I have no particular confidence in the kind of morality that is not rooted in the Church's faith.</p><p>Rosmer. And you mean that to apply to Rebecca and myself?—to my relations with Rebecca?</p><p>Kroll. I cannot make any departure, in favour of you two, from my opinion that there is certainly no very wide gulf between free thinking and—ahem!</p><p>Rosmer. And what?</p><p>Kroll. And free love, since you force me to say it.</p><p>Rosmer (gently). And you are not ashamed to say that to me!—you, who have known me ever since I was a boy.</p>",
  "page-88": "<p>Kroll. It is just for that reason. I know how easily you allow yourself to be influenced by those you associate with. And as for your Rebecca—well, your Miss West, then—to tell the truth, we know very little about her. To cut the matter short, Rosmer—I am not going to give you up. And you, on your part, ought to try and save yourself in time.</p><p>Rosmer. Save myself? How—? (MRS. HELSETH looks in through the door on the left. What do you want?)</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. I wanted to ask Miss West to come down, sir.</p><p>Rosmer. Miss West is not up here.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Indeed, sir? (Looks round the room. That is very strange. (Goes out.))</p><p>Rosmer. You were saying—?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Listen to me. As to what may have gone on here in secret while Beata was alive, and as to what may</p>",
  "page-89": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">be still going on here, I have no wish to inquire more closely. You were, of course, extremely unhappy in your marriage—and to some extent that may be urged in your excuse—</p><p>Rosmer. Oh, how little you really know me!</p><p>Kroll. Do not interrupt me. What I want to say is this. If you definitely must continue living with Miss West, it is absolutely necessary that you should conceal the revolution of opinion—I mean the distressing apostasy—that she has beguiled you into. Let me speak! Let me speak! I say that, if you are determined to go on with this folly, for heaven's sake hold any variety of ideas or opinions or beliefs you like—but keep your opinions to yourself. It is a purely personal matter, and there is not the slightest necessity to go proclaiming it all over the countryside.</p><p>Rosmer. It is a necessity for me to abandon a false and equivocal position.</p>",
  "page-90": "<p>Kroll. But you have a duty towards the traditions of your family, Rosmer! Remember that! From time immemorial Rosmersholm has been a stronghold of discipline and order, of respect and esteem for all that the best people in our community have upheld and sanctioned. The whole neighbourhood has taken its tone from Rosmersholm. If the report gets about that you yourself have broken with what I may call the Rosmer family tradition, it will evoke an irreparable state of unrest.</p><p>Rosmer. My dear Kroll, I cannot see the matter in that light. It seems to me that it is my imperative duty to bring a little light and happiness into the place where the race of Rosmers has spread darkness and oppression for all these long years.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll (looking severely at him). Yes, that would be a worthy action for the man with whom the race will disappear. Let such things alone, my friend. It is no</p>",
  "page-91": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">suitable task for you. You were meant to lead the peaceful life of a student.</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, that may be so. But nevertheless I want to try and play my humble part in the struggles of life.</p><p>Kroll. The struggles of life! Do you know what that will mean for you? It will mean war to the death with all your friends.</p><p>Rosmer (quietly). I do not imagine they are all such fanatics as you.</p><p>Kroll. You are a simple-minded creature, Rosmer—an inexperienced creature. You have no suspicion of the violence of the storm that will burst upon you. (MRS. HELSETH slightly opens the door on the left.)</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Miss West wishes me to ask you, sir</p><p>Rosmer. What is it?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. There is some one downstairs that wishes to speak to you for a minute, sir.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. Is it the gentleman that was here yesterday</p>",
  "page-92": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">afternoon, by any chance?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. No, it is that Mr. Mortensgaard.</p><p>Rosmer. Mortensgaard?</p><p>Kroll. Aha! So matters have got as far as that already, have they!</p><p>Rosmer. What does he want with me? Why did you not send him away?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Miss West told me to ask you if he might come up.</p><p>Rosmer. Tell him I am engaged, and—</p><p>Kroll (to MRS. HELSETH). No; show him up, please. (MRS. HELSETH goes out. KROLL takes up his hat. I quit the field—temporarily. But we have not fought the decisive action yet.)</p><p>Rosmer. As truly as I stand here, Kroll, I have absolutely nothing to do with Mortensgaard.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. I do not believe you any longer on any point. Under no circumstances shall I have any faith in you</p>",
  "page-93": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">after this. It is war to the knife now. We shall try if we cannot make you powerless to do any harm.</p><p>Rosmer. Oh, Kroll—how you have sunk! How low you have sunk!</p><p>Kroll. I? And a man like you has the face to say so? Remember Beata!</p><p>Rosmer. Are you harking back to that again!</p><p>Kroll. No. You must solve the riddle of the millrace as your conscience will allow you—if you have any conscience still left. (PETER MORTENSGAARD comes in softly and quietly, by the door on the left. He is a short, slightly built man with sparse reddish hair and beard. KROLL gives him a look of hatred. The \"Searchlight\" too, I see. Lighted at Rosmersholm! (Buttons up his coat.) That leaves me no doubt as to the course I should steer.)</p><p>Mortensgaard (quietly). The \"Searchlight\" will always be ready burning to light Mr. Kroll home.</p>",
  "page-94": "<p>Kroll. Yes, you have shown me your goodwill for a long time. To be sure there is a Commandment that forbids us to bear false witness against our neighbour—</p><p>Mortensgaard. Mr. Kroll has no need to instruct me in the Commandments.</p><p>Kroll. Not even in the sixth?</p><p>Rosmer. Kroll—!</p><p>Mortensgaard. If I needed such instruction, Mr. Rosmer is the most suitable person to give it me.</p><p>Kroll (with scarcely concealed scorn). Mr. Rosmer? Oh yes, the Reverend Mr. Rosmer is undoubtedly the most suitable man for that! I hope you will enjoy yourselves, gentlemen. (Goes out and slams the door after him.)</p><p>Rosmer (stands looking at the door, and says to himself). Yes, yes—it had to be so. (Turns round. Will you tell me, Mr. Mortensgaard, what has brought you out here to see me?)</p>",
  "page-95": "<p>Mortensgaard. It was really Miss West I wanted to see. I thought I ought to thank her for the kind letter I received from her yesterday.</p><p>Rosmer. I know she has written to you. Have you had a talk with her?</p><p>Mortensgaard. Yes, a little. (Smiles slightly. I hear that there has been a change of views in certain respects at Rosmersholm.)</p><p>Rosmer. My views have changed to a very considerable extent; I might almost say entirely.</p><p>Mortensgaard. That is what Miss West said. And that was why she thought I ought to come up and have a little chat with you about this.</p><p>Rosmer. About what, Mr. Mortensgaard?</p><p>Mortensgaard. May I have your permission to announce in the \"Searchlight\" that you have altered your opinions, and are going to devote yourself to the cause of free thought and progress?</p>",
  "page-96": "<p>Rosmer. By all means. I will go so far as to ask you to make the announcement.</p><p>Mortensgaard. Then it shall appear to-morrow. It will be a great and weighty piece of news that the Reverend Mr. Rosmer of Rosmersholm has made up his mind to join the forces of light in that direction too.</p><p>Rosmer. I do not quite understand you.</p><p>Mortensgaard. What I mean is that it implies the gain of strong moral support for our party every time we win over an earnest, Christian-minded adherent.</p><p>Rosmer (with some astonishment). Then you don't know—? Did Miss West not tell you that as well?</p><p>Mortensgaard. What, Mr. Rosmer? Miss West was in a considerable hurry. She told me to come up, and that I would hear the rest of it from yourself.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. Very well, then; let me tell you that I have cut myself free entirely—on every side. I have now, no connection of any kind with the tenets of the Church.</p>",
  "page-97": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">For the future such matters have not the smallest signification for me.</p><p>Mortensgaard (looking at him in perplexity). Well, if the moon had fallen down from the sky, I could not be more—! To think that I should ever hear you yourself renounce—!</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, I stand now where you have stood for a long time. You can announce that in the \"Searchlight\" to-morrow too.</p><p>Mortensgaard. That, too? No, my dear Mr. Rosmer—you must excuse me—but it is not worth touching on that side of the matter.</p><p>Rosmer. Not touch on it?</p><p>Mortensgaard. Not at first, I think.</p><p>Rosmer. But I do not understand—</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mortensgaard. Well, it is like this, Mr. Rosmer. You are not as familiar with all the circumstances of the case as I am, I expect. But if you, too, have joined the forces</p>",
  "page-98": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of freedom—and if you, as Miss West says you do, mean to take part in the movement—I conclude you do so with the desire to be as useful to the movement as you possibly can, in practice as well as, in theory.</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, that is my most sincere wish.</p><p>Mortensgaard. Very well. But I must impress on you, Mr. Rosmer, that if you come forward openly with this news about your defection from the Church, you will tie your own hands immediately.</p><p>Rosmer. Do you think so?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mortensgaard. Yes, you may be certain that there is not much that you would be able to do hereabouts. And besides, Mr. Rosmer, we have quite enough freethinkers already—indeed, I was going to say we have too many of those gentry. What the party needs is a Christian element—something that every one must respect. That is what we want badly. And for that reason it is most advisable that you should hold your</p>",
  "page-99": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">tongue about any matters that do not concern the public. That is my opinion.</p><p>Rosmer. I see. Then you would not risk having anything to do with me if I were to confess my apostasy openly?</p><p>Mortensgaard (shaking his head). I should not like to, Mr. Rosmer. Lately I have made it a rule never to support anybody or anything that is opposed to the interests of the Church.</p><p>Rosmer. Have you, then, entered the fold of the Church again lately?</p><p>Mortensgaard. That is another matter altogether.</p><p>Rosmer. Oh, that is how it is. Yes, I understand you now.</p><p>Mortensgaard. Mr. Rosmer—you ought to remember that I, of all people, have not absolute freedom of action.</p><p>Rosmer. What hampers you?</p>",
  "page-100": "<p>Mortensgaard. What hampers me is that I am a marked man.</p><p>Rosmer. Ah—of course.</p><p>Mortensgaard. A marked man, Mr. Rosmer. And you, of all people, ought to remember that—because you were responsible, more than any one else, for my being branded.</p><p>Rosmer. If I had stood then where I stand now, I should have handled the affair more judiciously.</p><p>Mortensgaard. I think so too. But it is too late now; you have branded me, once for all—branded me for life. I do not suppose you can fully realise what such a thing means. But it is possible that you may soon feel the smart of it yourself now, Mr. Rosmer.</p><p>Rosmer. I?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mortensgaard. Yes. You surely do not suppose that Mr. Kroll and his gang will be inclined to forgive a rupture such as yours? And the \"County News\" is going</p>",
  "page-101": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to be pretty bloodthirsty, I hear. It may very well come to pass that you will be a marked man, too.</p><p>Rosmer. On personal grounds, Mr. Mortensgaard, I feel myself to be invulnerable. My conduct does not offer any point of attack.</p><p>Mortensgaard (with a quiet smile). That is saying a good deal, Mr. Rosmer.</p><p>Rosmer. Perhaps it is. But I have the right to say as much.</p><p>Mortensgaard. Even if you were inclined to overhaul your conduct as thoroughly as you once overhauled mine?</p><p>Rosmer. You say that very strangely. What are you driving at?—is it anything definite?</p><p>Mortensgaard. Yes, there is one definite thing—no more than a single one. But it might be quite awkward enough if malicious opponents got a hint of it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. Will you have the kindness to tell me what</p>",
  "page-102": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">on earth it is?</p><p>Mortensgaard. Can you not guess, Mr. Rosmer?</p><p>Rosmer. No, not for a moment.</p><p>Mortensgaard. All right. I must come out with it, then. I have in my possession a remarkable letter, that was written here at Rosmersholm.</p><p>Rosmer. Miss West's letter, you mean? Is it so remarkable?</p><p>Mortensgaard. No, that letter is not remarkable. But I received a letter from this house on another occasion.</p><p>Rosmer. From Miss West?</p><p>Mortensgaard. No, Mr. Rosmer.</p><p>Rosmer. Well, from whom, then? From whom?</p><p>Mortensgaard. From your late wife.</p><p>Rosmer. From my wife? You had a letter from my wife?</p><p>Mortensgaard. Yes, I did.</p><p>Rosmer. When?</p>",
  "page-103": "<p>Mortensgaard. It was during the poor lady's last days. It must be about a year and a half ago now. And that is the letter that is so remarkable.</p><p>Rosmer. Surely you know that my wife's mind was affected at that time?</p><p>Mortensgaard. I know there were a great many people who thought so. But, in my opinion, no one would have imagined anything of the kind from the letter. When I say the letter is a remarkable one, I mean remarkable in quite another way.</p><p>Rosmer. And what in the world did my poor wife find to write to you about?</p><p>Mortensgaard. I have the letter at home. It begins more or less to the effect that she is living in perpetual terror and dread, because of the fact that there are so many evilly disposed people about her whose only desire is to do you harm and mischief.</p><p>Rosmer. Me?</p>",
  "page-104": "<p>Mortensgaard. Yes, so she says. And then follows the most remarkable part of it all. Shall I tell you, Mr. Rosmer?</p><p>Rosmer. Of course! Tell me everything, without any reserve.</p><p>Mortensgaard. The poor lady begs and entreats me to be magnanimous. She says that she knows it was you, who got me dismissed from my post as schoolmaster, and implores me most earnestly not to revenge myself upon you.</p><p>Rosmer. What way did she think you could revenge yourself, then?</p><p>Mortensgaard. The letter goes on to say that if I should hear that anything sinful was going on at Rosmersholm, I was not to believe a word of it; that it would be only the work of wicked folk who were spreading the rumours on purpose to do you harm.</p><p>Rosmer. Does the letter say that?</p>",
  "page-105": "<p>Mortensgaard. You may read it at your convenience, Mr. Rosmer.</p><p>Rosmer. But I cannot understand—? What did she imagine there could be any wicked rumours about?</p><p>Mortensgaard. In the first place, that you had broken away from the faith of your childhood. Mrs. Rosmer denied that absolutely—at that time. And, in the next place—ahem!</p><p>Rosmer. In the next place?</p><p>Mortensgaard. Well, in the next place she writes—though rather confusedly—that she has no knowledge of any sinful relations existing at Rosmersholm; that she has never been wronged in any way; and that if any rumours of that sort should get about, she entreats me not to allude to them in the \"Searchlight\".</p><p>Rosmer. Does she mention any names?</p><p>Mortensgaard. No.</p><p>Rosmer. Who brought you the letter?</p>",
  "page-106": "<p>Mortensgaard. I promised not to tell that. It was brought to me one evening after dark.</p><p>Rosmer.

I did make inquiries, Mr. Rosmer; but I must say I did not get exactly that impression.</p><p>Rosmer. Not?—But why have you chosen this moment to enlighten me as to the existence of this old crazy letter?</p><p>Mortensgaard.

No, sir, she is not here.</p><p>(The curtain at the end of the room is drawn back, disclosing REBECCA standing in the doorway.)</p><p>Rebecca. John!</p><p>Rosmer (turning round). What! Were you in there, in my bedroom! My dear, what were you doing there?</p><p>Rebecca (going up to him). I have been listening.</p><p>Rosmer. Rebecca! Could you do a thing like that?</p><p>Rebecca. Indeed I could. It was so horrid the way he said that—about my morning wrapper.</p><p>Rosmer. Ah, so you were in there too when Kroll—?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes. I wanted to know what was at the bottom of his mind.</p><p>Rosmer. You know I would have told you.</p><p>Rebecca. I scarcely think you would have told me everything—certainly not in his own words.</p><p>Rosmer. Did you hear everything, then?</p>",
  "page-109": "<p>Rebecca. Most of it, I think. I had to go down for a moment when Mortensgaard came.</p><p>Rosmer. And then came up again?</p><p>Rebecca.

Ah, I do not think I have ever stood so much in need of you as I do to-day.</p><p>Rebecca. Surely both you and I have been prepared for what would happen some day.</p><p>Rosmer. No, no—not for this.</p><p>Rebecca. Not for this?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. It is true that I used to think that sooner or later our beautiful pure friendship would come to be attacked by calumny and suspicion—not on Kroll's part, for I never would have believed such a thing of him—but on the part of the coarse-minded and ignoble-eyed crowd. Yes, indeed; I had good reason</p>",
  "page-110": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">enough for so jealously drawing a veil of concealment over our compact. It was a dangerous secret.</p><p>Rebecca.

It is true enough that I thought so until to-day. But now, now, Rebecca—</p><p>Rebecca. Yes? Now?</p><p>Rosmer. How am I to account to myself for Beata's horrible accusation?</p><p>Rebecca (impetuously). Oh, don't talk about Beata! Don't think about Beata any more! She is dead, and you seemed at last to have been able to get away from the thought of her.</p><p>Rosmer.

You may be sure she did not fail to notice that we read the same books; that we sought one another's company, and discussed every new topic together. But I cannot understand it—because I was always so careful to spare her. When I look back, it seems to me that I did everything I could to keep her apart from our lives. Or did I not, Rebecca?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, yes—undoubtedly you did.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. And so did you, too. And notwithstanding that—! Oh, it is horrible to think of!

Think of all the horrible things her poor diseased brain must have led her to believe about us and store up in her mind about us! Did she never speak to you of anything that could give you any kind of clue?</p><p>Rebecca (as if startled). To me! Do you suppose I should have remained here a day longer, if she had?</p><p>Rosmer. No, no—that is obvious. What a fight she must have fought—and fought alone, Rebecca! In despair, and all alone. And then, in the end, the poignant misery of her victory—which was also her accusation of us—in the mill-race!

You are right, it seems hard—hard, Rebecca. But I have no power of choice in the matter. How do you think I could ever get the mastery over it?</p><p>Rebecca (standing behind his chair).

I was thinking of what brought us together from the first, what links us so closely to one another—our common belief in the possibility of a man and a woman living together in chastity.</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, yes—what of it?</p><p>Rosmer. What I mean is—does not such a tie as that—such a tie as ours—seem to belong properly to a life lived in quiet, happy peacefulness?</p><p>Rebecca. Well?</p>",

HELSETH is going round the room with a feather brush, dusting the furniture.)</p><p>Rebecca (after a short pause). I wonder why Mr. Rosmer is so late in coming down to-day?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth.

The reason I ask is that he was not very well yesterday.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. No, he did not look well. It made me wonder whether something had gone amiss between him and his brother-in-law.</p><p>Rebecca. What do you suppose could go amiss between them?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. I can't say, miss. Perhaps it was that fellow Mortensgaard set them at loggerheads.</p><p>Rebecca. It is quite possible. Do you know anything of this Peter Mortensgaard?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Not I! How could you think so, miss—a man like that!</p><p>Rebecca. Because of that horrid paper he edits, you mean?</p>",
  "page-126": "<p>Mrs. Helseth. Not only because of that, miss. I suppose you have heard that a certain married woman, whose husband had deserted her, had a child by him?</p><p>Rebecca. I have heard it; but of course that was long before I came here.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Bless me, yes—he was quite a young man then. But she might have had more sense than he had. He wanted to marry her, too, but that could not be done; and so he had to pay heavily for it. But since then—my word!—Mortensgaard has risen in the world. There are lots of people who run after him now.</p><p>Rebecca. I believe most of the poor people turn to him first when they are in any trouble.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Oh, not only the poor people, miss—</p><p>Rebecca (glancing at her unobserved). Indeed?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth (standing at the sofa, dusting vigorously).

Because—if I must let out the secret at last—I carried a letter to Mortensgaard myself once.</p><p>Rebecca (turns round). No—did you!</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Yes, that I did. And that letter, let me tell you, was written here—at Rosmersholm.</p><p>Rebecca. Really, Mrs. Helseth?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. I give you my word it was, miss. And it was written on good note-paper—and sealed with beautiful red sealing-wax.</p><p>Rebecca. And you were entrusted with the delivery of it?

Yes, that had a terrible effect on her, poor lady.</p><p>Rebecca (taking up her work, and sitting down on a chair by the window). But, in other respects, do you not think that was really a good thing for Mr. Rosmer, Mrs. Helseth?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. What, miss?</p><p>Rebecca. That there were no children?</p>",
  "page-131": "<p>Mrs. Helseth. Hm!—I really do not know what to say to that.</p><p>Rebecca. Believe me, it was best for him.

No. In this house, little children have never been known to cry, as long as any one can remember.</p><p>Rebecca. That is very strange.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Yes, isn't it, miss?

Truly in THAT respect?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer (laying his hat down on the table). This is the question I have been wrestling with—whether we</p>",
  "page-139": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">two have deluded ourselves the whole time, when we have been calling the tie between us merely friendship.</p><p>Rebecca. Do you mean, then, that the right name for it would have been—?</p><p>Rosmer. Love. Yes, dear, that is what I mean. Even while Beata was alive, it was you that I gave all my thoughts to. It was you alone I yearned for. It was with you that I experienced peaceful, joyful, passionless happiness. When we consider it rightly, Rebecca, our life together began like the sweet, mysterious love of two children for one another—free from desire or any thought of anything more. Did you not feel it in that way too? Tell me.</p><p>Rebecca (struggling with herself). Oh, I do not know what to answer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. And it was this life of intimacy, with one another and for one another, that we took to be friendship. No, dear—the tie between us has been a</p>",
  "page-140": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">spiritual marriage—perhaps from the very first day. That is why I am guilty. I had no right to it—no right to it for Beata's sake.</p><p>Rebecca. No right to a happy life? Do you believe that, John?</p><p>Rosmer. She looked at the relations between us through the eyes of HER love—judged them after the nature of HER love. And it was only natural. She could not have judged them otherwise than she did.</p><p>Rebecca. But how can you so accuse yourself for Beata's delusions?</p><p>Rosmer. It was for love of me—in her own way that—she threw herself into the mill-race. That fact is certain, Rebecca. I can never get beyond that.</p><p>Rebecca. Oh, do not think of anything else but the great, splendid task that you are going to devote your life to!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer (shaking his head). It can never be carried</p>",
  "page-141": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">through. Not by me. Not after what I know now.</p><p>Rebecca. Why not by you?</p><p>Rosmer. Because no cause can ever triumph which has its beginnings in guilt.</p><p>Rebecca (impetuously). Oh, these are nothing but prejudices you have inherited—these doubts, these fears, these scruples! You have a legend here that your dead return to haunt you in the form of white horses. This seems to me to be something of that sort.</p><p>Rosmer. Be that as it may, what difference does it make if I cannot shake it off? Believe me, Rebecca, it is as I say—any cause which is to win a lasting victory must be championed by a man who is joyous and innocent.</p><p>Rebecca. But is joy so absolutely indispensable to you, John?</p><p>Rosmer. Joy? Yes, indeed it is.</p><p>Rebecca. To you, who never laugh?</p>",
  "page-142": "<p>Rosmer. Yes, in spite of that. Believe me, I have a great capacity for joy.</p><p>Rebecca. Now you really must go out, dear—for a long walk—a really long one, do you hear? There is your hat, and there is your stick.</p><p>Rosmer (taking them from her). Thank you. And you won't come too?</p><p>Rebecca. No, no, I can't come now.</p><p>Rosmer. Very well. You are none the less always with me now. (Goes out by the entrance hall. After a moment REBECCA peeps out from behind the door which he has left open. Then she goes to the door on the right, which she opens.)</p><p>Rebecca (in a whisper). Now, Mrs. Helseth. You can let him come in now. (Crosses to the window. A moment later, KROLL comes in from the right. He bows to her silently and formally and keeps his hat in his hand.)</p>",
  "page-143": "<p>Kroll. Has he gone, then?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes.</p><p>Kroll. Does he generally stay out long?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes. But to-day he is in a very uncertain mood—so, if you do not want to meet him—</p><p>Kroll. Certainly not. It is you I wish to speak to—and quite alone.</p><p>Rebecca. Then we had better make the best of our time. Please sit down. (She sits down in an easy-chair by the window. KROLL takes a chair beside her.)</p><p>Kroll. Miss West, you can scarcely have any idea how deeply pained and unhappy I am over this revolution that has taken place in John Rosmer's ideas.</p><p>Rebecca. We were prepared for that being so—at first.</p><p>Kroll. Only at first?</p><p>Rosmer. Mr. Rosmer hoped confidently that sooner or later you would take your place beside him.</p>",
  "page-144": "<p>Kroll. I?</p><p>Rebecca. You and all his other friends.</p><p>Kroll. That should convince you how feeble his judgment is on any matter concerning his fellow-creatures and the affairs of real life.</p><p>Rebecca. In any case, now that he feels the absolute necessity of cutting himself free on all sides—</p><p>Kroll. Yes; but, let me tell you, that is exactly what I do not believe.</p><p>Rebecca. What do you believe, then?</p><p>Kroll. I believe it is you that are at the bottom of the whole thing.</p><p>Rebecca. Your wife put that into your head, Mr. Kroll.</p><p>Kroll. It does not matter who put it into my head. The point is this, that I feel grave doubts—exceedingly grave doubts—when I recall and think over the whole of your behaviour since you came here.</p>",
  "page-145": "<p>Rebecca (looking at him). I have a notion that there was a time when you had an exceedingly strong BELIEF in me, dear Mr. Kroll—I might almost say, a warm belief.</p><p>Kroll (in a subdued voice). I believe you could bewitch any one—if you set yourself to do it.</p><p>Rebecca. And you say I set myself to do it!</p><p>Kroll. Yes, you did. I am no longer such a simpleton as to suppose that sentiment entered into your little game at all. You simply wanted to secure yourself admission to Rosmersholm—to establish yourself here. That was what I was to help you to. I see it now.</p><p>Rebecca. Then you have completely forgotten that it was Beata that begged and entreated me to come and live here.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Yes, because you had bewitched her too. Are you going to pretend that friendship is the name for what she came to feel towards you? It was</p>",
  "page-146": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">idolatry—adoration. It degenerated into a—what shall I call, it?—a sort of desperate passion. Yes, that is just the word for it.</p><p>Rebecca. Have the goodness to remember the condition your sister was in. As far as I am concerned I do not think I can be said to be particularly emotional in any way.</p><p>Kroll. No, you certainly are not. But that makes you all the more dangerous to those whom you wish to get into your power. It comes easy to you to act with deliberation and careful calculation, just because you have a cold heart.</p><p>Rebecca. Cold? Are you so sure of that?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. I am certain of it now. Otherwise you could not have pursued your object here so unswervingly, year after year. Yes, yes—you have gained what you wanted. You have got him and everything else here into your power. But, to carry out your schemes, you have not</p>",
  "page-147": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">scrupled to make him unhappy.</p><p>Rebecca. That is not true. It is not I; it is you yourself that have made him unhappy.</p><p>Kroll. I!</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, by leading him to imagine that he was responsible for the terrible end that overtook Beata.</p><p>Kroll. Did that affect him so deeply, then?</p><p>Rebecca. Of course. A man of such gentle disposition as he—</p><p>Kroll. I imagined that one of your so-called \"emancipated\" men would know how to overcome any scruples. But there it is! Oh, yes—as a matter of fact it turned out just as I expected. The descendant of the men who are looking at us from these walls need not think he can break loose from what has been handed down as an inviolable inheritance from generation to generation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca (looking thoughtfully in front of her). John</p>",
  "page-148": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Rosmer's nature is deeply rooted in his ancestors. That is certainly very true.</p><p>Kroll. Yes, and you ought to have taken that into consideration, if you had had any sympathy for him. But I dare say you were incapable of that sort of consideration. Your starting-point is so very widely-removed from his, you see.</p><p>Rebecca. What do you mean by my starting-point?</p><p>Kroll. I mean the starting-point of origin—of parentage, Miss West.</p><p>Rebecca. I see. Yes, it is quite true that my origin is very humble. But nevertheless—</p><p>Kroll. I am not alluding to rank or position. I am thinking of the moral aspect of your origin.</p><p>Rebecca. Of my origin? In what respect?</p><p>Kroll. In respect of your birth generally.</p><p>Rebecca. What are you saying!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. I am only saying it because it explains the</p>",
  "page-149": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">whole of your conduct.</p><p>Rebecca. I do not understand. Be so good as to tell me exactly what you mean.</p><p>Kroll. I really thought you did not need telling. Otherwise it would seem a very strange thing that you let yourself be adopted by Dr. West.</p><p>Rebecca (getting up). Oh, that is it! Now I understand.</p><p>Kroll. And took his name. Your mother's name was Gamvik.</p><p>Rebecca (crossing the room). My father's name was Gamvik, Mr. Kroll.</p><p>Kroll. Your mother's occupation must, of course, have brought her continually into contact with the district physician.</p><p>Rebecca. You are quite right.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. And then he takes you to live with him, immediately upon your mother's death. He treats you</p>",
  "page-150": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">harshly, and yet you stay with him. You know that he will not leave you a single penny—as a matter of fact you only got a box of books—and yet you endure living with him, put up with his behaviour, and nurse him to the end.</p><p>Rebecca (comes to the table and looks at him scornfully). And my doing all that makes it clear to you that there was something immoral—something criminal about my birth!</p><p>Kroll. What you did for him, I attributed to an unconscious filial instinct. And, as far as the rest of it goes, I consider that the whole of your conduct has been the outcome of your origin.</p><p>Rebecca (hotly). But there is not a single word of truth in what you say! And I can prove it! Dr. West had not come to Finmark when I was born.</p><p>Kroll. Excuse me, Miss West. He went there a year before you were born. I have ascertained that.</p>",
  "page-151": "<p>Rebecca. You are mistaken, I tell you! You are absolutely mistaken!</p><p>Kroll. You said here, the day before yesterday, that you were twenty-nine—going on for thirty.</p><p>Rebecca. Really? Did I say that?</p><p>Kroll. Yes, you did. And from that I can calculate—</p><p>Rebecca. Stop! That will not help you to calculate. For, I may as well tell you at once, I am a year older than I give myself out to be.</p><p>Kroll (smiling incredulously). Really? That is something new. How is that?</p><p>Rebecca. When I had passed my twenty-fifth birthday, I thought I was getting altogether too old for an unmarried girl, so I resolved to tell a lie and take a year off my age.</p><p>Kroll. You—an emancipated woman—cherishing prejudices as to the marriageable age!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. I know it was a silly thing to do—and</p>",
  "page-152": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ridiculous, too. But every one has some prejudice or another that they cannot get quite rid of. We are like that.</p><p>Kroll. Maybe. But my calculation may be quite correct, all the same; because Dr. West was up in Finmark for a flying visit the year before he was appointed.</p><p>Rebecca (impetuously). That is not true</p><p>Kroll. Isn't it?</p><p>Rebecca. No. My mother never mentioned it.</p><p>Kroll. Didn't she, really!</p><p>Rebecca. No, never. Nor Dr. West, either. Never a word of it.</p><p>Kroll. Might that not be because they both had good reason to jump over a year?—@just as you have done yourself, Miss West? Perhaps it is a family failing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca (walking about, wringing her hands). It is impossible. It is only something you want to make me</p>",
  "page-153": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">believe. Nothing in the world will make me believe it. It cannot be true! Nothing in the world—</p><p>Kroll (getting up). But, my dear Miss West, why in Heaven's name do you take it in this way? You quite alarm me! What am I to believe and think?</p><p>Rebecca. Nothing. Neither believe nor think anything.</p><p>Kroll. Then you really must give me some explanation of your taking this matter—this possibility—so much to heart.</p><p>Rebecca (controlling herself). It is quite obvious, I should think, Mr. Kroll. I have no desire for people here to think me an illegitimate child.</p><p>Kroll. Quite so. Well, well, let us be content with your explanation, for the present. But you see that is another point on which you have cherished a certain prejudice.</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, that is quite true.</p>",
  "page-154": "<p>Kroll. And it seems to me that very much the same applies to most of this \"emancipation\" of yours, as you call it. Your reading has introduced you to a hotch-potch of new ideas and opinions; you have made a certain acquaintance with researches that are going on in various directions—researches that seem to you to upset a good many ideas that people have hitherto considered incontrovertible and unassailable. But all this has never gone any further than knowledge in your case, Miss West—a mere matter of the intellect. It has not got into your blood.</p><p>Rebecca (thoughtfully). Perhaps you are right.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kroll. Yes, only test yourself, and you will see! And if it is true in your case, it is easy to recognise how true it must be in John Rosmer's. Of course it is madness, pure and simple. He will be running headlong to his ruin if he persists in coming openly forward and proclaiming himself an apostate! Just think of it—he, with his shy</p>",
  "page-155": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">disposition! Think of HIM disowned—hounded out of the circle to which he has always belonged—exposed to the uncompromising attacks of all the best people in the place. Nothing would ever make him the man to endure that.</p><p>Rebecca. He MUST endure it! It is too late now for him to draw back.</p><p>Kroll. Not a bit too late—not by any means too late. What has happened can be hushed up—or at any rate can be explained away as a purely temporary, though regrettable, aberration. But—there is one step that it is absolutely essential he should take.</p><p>Rebecca. And that is?</p><p>Kroll. You must get him to legalise his position, Miss West.</p><p>Rebecca. The position in which he stands to me?</p><p>Kroll. Yes. You must see that you get him to do that.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. Then you can't rid yourself of the</p>",
  "page-156": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">conviction that the relations between us need \"legalising,\" as you say?</p><p>Kroll. I do not wish to go any more precisely into the question. But I certainly have observed that the conditions under which it always seems easiest for people to abandon all their so-called prejudices are when—ahem!</p><p>Rebecca. When it is a question of the relations between a man and a woman, I suppose you mean?</p><p>Kroll. Yes—to speak candidly—that is what I mean.</p><p>Rebecca (walks across the room and looks out of the window). I was on the point of saying that I wish you had been right, Mr. Kroll.</p><p>Kroll. What do you mean by that? You say it so strangely!</p><p>Rebecca. Oh, nothing! Do not let us talk any more about it. Ah, there he is!</p><p>Kroll. Already! I will go, then.</p>",
  "page-157": "<p>Rebecca (turning to him). No—stay here, and you will hear something.</p><p>Kroll. Not now. I do not think I could bear to see him.</p><p>Rebecca. I beg you to stay. Please do, or you will regret it later. It is the last time I shall ever ask you to do anything.</p><p>Kroll (looks at her in surprise, and lays his hat down). Very well, Miss West. It shall be as you wish. (A short pause. Then ROSMER comes in from the hall.)</p><p>Rosmer (stops at the door, as he sees KROLL). What! you here?</p><p>Rebecca. He wanted to avoid meeting you, John.</p><p>Kroll (involuntarily). \"John?\"</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, Mr. Kroll. John and I call each other by our Christian names. That is a natural consequence of the relations between us.</p><p>Kroll. Was that what I was to hear if I stayed?</p>",
  "page-158": "<p>Rebecca. Yes, that and something else.</p><p>Rosmer (coming into the room). What is the object of your visit here to-day?</p><p>Kroll. I wanted to make one more effort to stop you, and win you back.</p><p>Rosmer (pointing to the newspaper). After that?</p><p>Kroll. I did not write it.</p><p>Rosmer. Did you take any steps to prevent its appearing?</p><p>Kroll. That would have been acting unjustifiably towards the cause I serve. And, besides that, I had no power to prevent it.</p><p>Rebecca (tears the newspaper into pieces, which she crumples up and throws into the back of the stove). There! Now it is out of sight; let it be out of mind too. Because there will be no more of that sort of thing, John.</p><p>Kroll. Indeed, I wish you could ensure that.</p>",
  "page-159": "<p>Rebecca. Come, and let us sit down, dear—all three of us. Then I will tell you all about it.</p><p>Rosmer (sitting down involuntarily). What has come over you, Rebecca? You are so unnaturally calm—What is it?</p><p>Rebecca. The calmness of determination. (Sits down. Please sit down too, Mr. Kroll. (He takes a seat on the couch.))</p><p>Rosmer. Determination, you say. Determination to do what?</p><p>Rebecca. I want to give you back what you need in order to live your life. You shall have your happy innocence back, dear friend.</p><p>Rosmer. But what do you mean?</p><p>Rebecca. I will just tell you what happened. That is all that is necessary.</p><p>Rosmer. Well?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. When I came down here from Finmark</p>",
  "page-160": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with Dr. West, it seemed to me that a new, great, wide world was opened to me.

And then—)</p><p>Kroll. And then?</p><p>Rosmer. But, Rebecca—I know all this.</p><p>Rebecca (collecting herself). Yes—that is true enough. You know it only too well.</p><p>Kroll (looking fixedly at her). Perhaps it would be better if I left you.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca. No, stay where you are, dear Mr. Kroll. (To ROSMER. Well, this was how it was. I wanted to play my part in the new day that was dawning—to have a share in all the new ideas. Mr. Kroll told me one day that Ulrik Brendel had had a great influence over you once, when you were a boy. I thought it might be</p>",
  "page-161": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">possible for me to resume that influence here.)</p><p>Rosmer. Did you come here with a covert design?</p><p>Rebecca. What I wanted was that we two should go forward together on the road towards freedom—always forward, and further forward! But there was that gloomy, insurmountable barrier between you and a full, complete emancipation.</p><p>Rosmer. What barrier do you mean?</p><p>Rebecca. I mean, John, that you could never have attained freedom except in the full glory of the sunshine. And, instead of that, here you were—ailing and languishing in the gloom of such a marriage as yours.</p><p>Rosmer. You have never spoken to me of my marriage in that way, before to-day.</p><p>Rebecca. No, I did not dare, for fear of frightening you.</p><p>Kroll (nodding to ROSMER). You hear that!</p>",
  "page-162": "<p>Rebecca (resuming). But I saw quite well where your salvation lay—your only salvation. And so I acted.</p><p>Rosmer. How do you mean—you acted?</p><p>Kroll. Do you mean that?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, John. (Gets up. No, do not get up. Nor you either, Mr. Kroll. But we must let in the daylight now. It was not you, John. You are innocent.

Into the path that—led to the mill-race. Now you know it, both of you.</p><p>Rosmer (as if stunned). But I do not understand—What is she standing there saying? I do not understand a word—</p><p>Kroll. Yes, yes. I begin to understand.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer. But what did you do? What did you find to</p>",

She got to know that you were determined to emancipate yourself from all your old prejudices.</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, but at that time I had come to no decision.</p><p>Rebecca. I knew that you soon would come to one.</p><p>Kroll (nodding to ROSMER). Aha!</p><p>Rosmer. Well—and what more? I want to know everything now.</p><p>Rebecca. Some time afterwards, I begged and implored her to let me leave Rosmersholm.</p><p>Rosmer. Why did you want to leave here—then?</p><p>Rebecca. I did not want to. I wanted to remain where I was. But I told her that it would be best for us all if I went away in time. I let her infer that if I remained here any longer I could not tell what-what-might happen.</p>",

Have you confessed everything now, Rebecca?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes.</p><p>Kroll. Not everything.</p><p>Rebecca (looking at him in terror). What else can there be?</p><p>Kroll.

Perhaps I did say something of the sort.</p>",

You know she had taken it into her head that she, a childless wife, had no right to be here. And so she persuaded herself that her duty to you was to give place to another.</p><p>Rosmer.

Yes, I dare say it will be all right to write. But, poor dear, I really think that you ought to try and have a talk with him once more.</p><p>Rebecca. Perhaps I ought—Or perhaps not, after all.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Dear, dear! I never thought I should, live to see such a thing as this!</p><p>Rebecca. What did you think, then, Mrs. Helseth?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. To tell the truth, miss, I thought Mr. Rosmer was an honester man than that.</p><p>Rebecca. Honester?</p>",
  "page-173": "<p>Mrs. Helseth. Yes, miss, that is the truth.</p><p>Rebecca. But, my dear Mrs. Helseth, what do you mean by that?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. I mean what is true and right, miss.

Tell me, honestly and frankly, why you think I am going away.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Good Lord, miss—because it is necessary, I suppose. Well, well!—Still, I certainly do not think Mr. Rosmer has behaved well. There was some excuse in Mortensgaard's case, because the woman's husband was still alive; so that it was impossible for them to marry, however much they wished it. But Mr. Rosmer, he could—ahem!</p><p>Rebecca (with a faint smile). Is it possible that you could think such things about me and Mr. Rosmer?</p>",
  "page-174": "<p>Mrs. Helseth. Not for a moment—until to-day, I mean.</p><p>Rebecca. But why to-day?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Well, after all the horrible things they tell me one may see in the papers about Mr. Rosmer—</p><p>Rebecca. Ah!</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. What I mean is this—if a man can go over to Mortensgaard's religion, you may believe him capable of anything. And that's the truth.</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, very likely. But about me? What have you got to say about me?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Well, I am sure, miss—I do not think you are so greatly to be blamed. It is not always so easy for a lone woman to resist, I dare say. We are all human after all, Miss West.</p><p>Rebecca. That is very true, Mrs. Helseth. We are all human, after all.—What are you listening to?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mrs. Helseth (in a low voice). Good Lord!—I</p>",

I had a will of my own, and some courage, when I came here. Now I am crushed under the law of strangers. I do not think I shall have the courage to begin anything else in the world after this.</p><p>Rosmer. Why not? What do you mean by being crushed under a law—?</p><p>Rebecca. Dear friend, do not let us talk about that now—Tell me what passed between you and Mr. Kroll.</p><p>Rosmer. We have made our peace.</p><p>Rebecca. Quite so. So it came to that.</p>",

I have come to that opinion—in the last day or two.</p><p>Rosmer. You are lying, Rebecca.</p><p>Rebecca. Lying—?</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, lying. You have never believed in me.

I believe I could have carried anything through—at that time. For then I still had the courage of a free will. I had no one else to consider, nothing to turn me from my path. But then began what has broken down my will and filled the whole of my life with dread and wretchedness.</p><p>Rosmer. What—began? Speak so that I can understand you.</p><p>Rebecca.

It was what I have said—a wild, uncontrollable passion.</p><p>Rosmer (speaking with difficulty). Rebecca—is it really you—you—who are sitting here telling me this?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, indeed it is, John.</p><p>Rosmer. Then it was as the outcome of this—and under the influence of this—that you \"acted,\" as you called it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rebecca.

Yes—it was like a fight for life between Beata and me at that time.</p><p>Rosmer. You proved the strongest of us all at Rosmersholm—stronger than both Beata and me put together.</p><p>Rebecca. I knew you well enough to know that I could not get at you in any way until you were set free—both in actual circumstances and in your soul.</p><p>Rosmer. But I do not understand you, Rebecca. You—you yourself and your whole conduct—are an insoluble riddle to me. I am free now—both in my soul and my circumstances.

And nevertheless, I say, when yesterday I asked you—urged you—to become my wife, you cried out that it never could be.</p><p>Rebecca. I cried out in despair, John.</p><p>Rosmer. Why?</p><p>Rebecca. Because Rosmersholm has unnerved me. All the courage has been sapped out of my will here—crushed out! The time has gone for me to dare risk anything whatever. I have lost all power of action, John.</p><p>Rosmer. Tell me how that has come about.</p><p>Rebecca. It has come about through my living with you.</p><p>Rosmer. But how? How?</p><p>Rebecca. When I was alone with you here—and you had really found yourself—</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, yes?</p>",

When it came about that I was living together with you here, in peace and solitude—when you exchanged all your thoughts with me unreservedly—your every mood, however tender or intimate—then the great change happened in me. Little by little, you understand. Almost imperceptibly—but overwhelmingly in the end, till it reached the uttermost depths of my soul.</p><p>Rosmer. What does this mean, Rebecca?</p><p>Rebecca. All the other feeling—all that horrible passion that had drowned my better self—left me entirely. All the violent emotions that had been roused in me were quelled and silenced. A peace stole over my soul—a quiet like that of one of our mountain peaks up under the midnight sun.</p>",

Oh, if only I had had the slightest suspicion of all this!</p><p>Rebecca. It is best as it is. Yesterday, when you asked me if I would be your wife, I gave a cry of joy—</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, it was that, Rebecca, was it not! I thought that was what it meant.</p><p>Rebecca. For a moment, yes-I forgot myself for a moment. It was my dauntless will of the old days that was struggling to be free again. But now it has no more strength—it has lost it for ever.</p><p>Rosmer.

Ah, if I dared believe that to be true!</p><p>Rebecca. You may believe it confidently. The Rosmer attitude towards life ennobles. But-(shakes her head)-but-but—</p><p>Rosmer. But? Well?</p><p>Rebecca. But it kills joy, you know.</p><p>Rosmer. Do you say that, Rebecca?</p><p>Rebecca. For me, at all events.</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, but are you so sure of that?

It has? And yet—notwithstanding that, you—?</p><p>Rosmer. I never believed in it. I only played with the idea-nothing more.</p><p>Rebecca. If you wish, I will tell you all about it at once.</p><p>Rosmer (stopping her). No, no! I do not want to hear a word about it. Whatever it is, it shall be forgotten, as far as I am concerned.</p><p>Rebecca. But I cannot forget it.</p><p>Rosmer. Oh, Rebecca—!</p>",

Where am I to get that from?</p><p>Rosmer (gloomily). Ah, yes—innocence.</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, innocence—which is at the root of all joy and happiness. That was the teaching, you know, that you wanted to see realised by all the men you were going to raise up to nobility and happiness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rosmer.

Ah, Rebecca, how can I believe you entirely—you whose life here has been nothing but continual concealment and secrecy!—And now you have this new tale to tell.
