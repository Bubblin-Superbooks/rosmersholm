In the foreground, against the right-hand wall, is a stove decorated with sprigs of fresh birch and wild flowers. Farther back, a door. In the back wall folding doors leading into the entrance hall. In the left-hand wall a window, in front of which is a stand filled with flowers and plants. Near the stove stand a table, a couch and an easy-chair. The walls are hung round with portraits, dating from various periods, of clergymen, military officers and other officials in uniform. The window is open, and so are the doors into the lobby and the outer door. Through the latter is seen an avenue of old trees leading to a courtyard. It is a summer evening, after sunset. REBECCA WEST is sitting by the window crocheting a large white woollen shawl, which is nearly completed. From time to time she peeps out of window through the flowers. MRS. HELSETH comes in from the right.)</p>"

    "innerHtml": "Kroll. Well, under any circumstances, I should never expect you, as a woman, to side actively with either party in the civic dispute—indeed one might more properly call it the civil war—that is raging here. I dare say you have read, then, the abuse these \"nature's gentlemen\" are pleased to shower upon me, and the scandalous coarseness they consider they are entitled to make use of?"

  },

    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Rebecca. You mustn't think that Dr. West was as unreasonable as that when we lived in Finmark. It was the trying journeys by sea that broke him up. But it is quite true that after we had moved here there were one or two hard years before his sufferings were over."

    "innerHtml": "Kroll. But what on earth could make you take such an idea into your head?"
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Rebecca. I began to be afraid it might be so, as you have so seldom been out here to see us lately."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Kroll. I can assure you, you have been on the wrong scent entirely, Miss West. And, in any case, the situation of affairs is unchanged in any essential point; because during the last sad years of poor Beata's life it was you and you alone, even then, that looked after everything here."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Rebecca. But it was more like a kind of regency in the wife's name."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Kroll. Whatever it was, I—. I will tell you what, Miss West; as far as I am concerned I should have nothing whatever to say against it if you. But it doesn't do to say such things."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Rebecca. What things?"
  },

    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Kroll. Well, if it so happened that you were to step into the empty place—"

    "innerHtml": "Rebecca. Really, you almost make me feel inclined to laugh at you."
  },

  },

  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Kroll. Quite so. And Rosmer—how old is he? Let me see. He is five years younger than me, so he must be just about forty-three. It seems to me it would be very suitable."
  },

    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Rebecca. No doubt, no doubt. It would be remarkably suitable—Will you stop and have supper with us?"

  },

    "innerHtml": "Rosmer. It was a very kind thought on your part. You are always so considerate. But it was altogether unnecessary to keep away from us on that account. Come along, let us sit down on the sofa. (They sit down. I can assure you it is not in the least painful for me to think about Beata. We talk about her every day.

Now that the Radicals have become so distressingly powerful, it was high time. And that is also why I have induced our little circle of friends in the town to bind themselves more definitely together. It was high time, I can tell you!"

But, my dear Kroll, you surely do not suppose that we were so imprudent as to let the poor sick creature get wind of any such ideas? I can solemnly swear that we were in no way to blame. It was the overwrought nerves of her own brain that were responsible for these frantic aberrations."
