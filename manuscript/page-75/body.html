<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rosmer. And what have you got to say to-day?</p><p>Kroll. It will take me some time, Rosmer. Let me begin with a sort of introduction. I can give you some news of Ulrick Brendel.</p><p>Rosmer. Has he been to see you?</p><p>Kroll. No. He took up his quarters in a low-class tavern—in the lowest kind of company, of course; drank, and stood drinks to others, as long as he had any money left; and then began to abuse the whole lot of them as a contemptible rabble—and, indeed, as far as that goes he was quite right. But the result was, that he got a thrashing and was thrown out into the gutter.</p><p>Rosmer. I see he is altogether incorrigible.</p><p>Kroll. He had pawned the coat you gave him, too, but that is going to be redeemed for him. Can you guess by whom?</p><p>Rosmer. By yourself, perhaps?</p><p>Kroll. No. By our noble friend Mr. Mortensgaard.</p></div> </div>
