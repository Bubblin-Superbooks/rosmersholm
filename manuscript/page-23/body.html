<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rebecca. I am ashamed to say I was twenty-nine on my last birthday, Mr. Kroll. I am nearly thirty.</p><p>Kroll. Quite so. And Rosmer—how old is he? Let me see. He is five years younger than me, so he must be just about forty-three. It seems to me it would be very suitable.</p><p>Rebecca. No doubt, no doubt. It would be remarkably suitable—Will you stop and have supper with us?</p><p>Kroll. Thank you. I had meant to pay you a good long visit, because there is a matter I want to talk over with our excellent friend—Well, then, Miss West, to prevent your taking foolish ideas into your head again, I will come out here again from time to time, as in the old days.</p><p>Rebecca. Yes, please do. (Holds out her hand to, him. Thank you, thank you! You are really uncommonly good-natured.)</p></div> </div>
