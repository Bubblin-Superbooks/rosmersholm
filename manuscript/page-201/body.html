There is a horrible temptation in this—!</p><p>Rebecca. Because I should not like to be left lying there—any longer than need be. You must take care that they find me.</p><p>Rosmer (springing up). But all this is madness, you know. Go away, or stay! I will believe you on your bare word this time too.</p><p>Rebecca. Those are mere words, John. No more cowardice or evasion! How can you believe me on my bare word after today?</p></div> </div>
