Ah, there is nothing left to save in me.</p><p>Rebecca. There is. But I—after this I should only be like some sea-sprite hanging on to the barque you are striving to sail forward in, and, hampering its progress. I must go overboard. Do you think I could go through the world bearing the burden of a spoiled life—brooding for ever over the happiness which I have forfeited by my past? I must throw up the game, John.</p><p>Rosmer. If you go—then I go with you.</p><p>Rebecca (looks at him with an almost imperceptible smile, and says more gently): Yes, come with me, dear—and be witness—</p><p>Rosmer. I go with you, I said.</p><p>Rebecca. As far as the bridge—yes. You never dare go out on to it, you know.</p></div> </div>
