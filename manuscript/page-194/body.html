Peter Mortensgaard is capable of living his life without ideals. And that, believe me, is precisely the great secret of success in life. It sums up all the wisdom of the world. Basta!</p><p>Rosmer (in a low voice). Now I see that you are going away from here poorer than you came.</p><p>Brendel. Bien! Then take an example from your old tutor. Erase from your mind everything that he imprinted there. Do not build your castle upon the shifting sand. And look well ahead, and be sure of your ground, before you build upon the charming creature who is sweetening your life here.</p><p>Rebecca. Do you mean me?</p><p>Brendel. Yes, most attractive mermaid!</p><p>Rebecca. Why am I not fit to build upon?</p></div> </div>
