<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs. Helseth. Not only because of that, miss. I suppose you have heard that a certain married woman, whose husband had deserted her, had a child by him?</p><p>Rebecca. I have heard it; but of course that was long before I came here.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Bless me, yes—he was quite a young man then. But she might have had more sense than he had. He wanted to marry her, too, but that could not be done; and so he had to pay heavily for it. But since then—my word!—Mortensgaard has risen in the world. There are lots of people who run after him now.</p><p>Rebecca. I believe most of the poor people turn to him first when they are in any trouble.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Oh, not only the poor people, miss—</p><p>Rebecca (glancing at her unobserved). Indeed?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth (standing at the sofa, dusting vigorously). People you would least expect, sometimes, miss.</p></div> </div>
