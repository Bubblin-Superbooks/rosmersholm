REBECCA goes to the wall and rings a bell, which is answered by MRS. HELSETH. You can clear the table again, Mrs. Helseth. Mr. Rosmer does not want anything, and Mr. Kroll has gone home.)</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Gone home? What was wrong with him, miss?</p><p>Rebecca (taking up her crochet-work). He prophesied that there was a heavy storm brewing—</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. That is very strange, miss, because there isn't a scrap of cloud in the sky.</p><p>Rebecca. Let us hope he doesn't meet the White Horse. Because I am afraid it will not be long before we hear something of the family ghost.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. God forgive you, miss—don't talk of such a dreadful thing!</p></div> </div>
