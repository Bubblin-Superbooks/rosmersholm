Suppose he is not back by that time?</p><p>Rebecca. I shall start, all the same. If I should not see him, you can tell him I will write to him—a long letter, say that.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Yes, I dare say it will be all right to write. But, poor dear, I really think that you ought to try and have a talk with him once more.</p><p>Rebecca. Perhaps I ought—Or perhaps not, after all.</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. Dear, dear! I never thought I should, live to see such a thing as this!</p><p>Rebecca. What did you think, then, Mrs. Helseth?</p><p>Mrs. Helseth. To tell the truth, miss, I thought Mr. Rosmer was an honester man than that.</p><p>Rebecca. Honester?</p></div> </div>
