You are a dreamer, Rosmer. Are you going to emancipate them? Are you going to purify them?</p><p>Rosmer. No, my dear fellow—I can only try to awake the desire for it in them.

There is no other that can do it.</p><p>Kroll (getting up). Is that speaking as befits a clergyman?</p><p>Rosmer. I am a clergyman no longer.</p><p>Kroll. Yes, but—what of the faith you were brought up in?</p></div> </div>
