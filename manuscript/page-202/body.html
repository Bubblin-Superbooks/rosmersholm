<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rosmer. But I do not want to see your defeat, Rebecca.</p><p>Rebecca. There will be no defeat.</p><p>Rosmer. There will. You will never have the heart to go Beata's way.</p><p>Rebecca. Do you believe that?</p><p>Rosmer. Never. You are not like Beata. You are not under the influence of a distorted view of life.</p><p>Rebecca. But I am under the influence of the Rosmersholm view of Life—now. Whatever my offences are—it is right that I should expiate them.</p><p>Rosmer (looking at her fixedly). Have you come to that decision?</p><p>Rebecca. Yes.</p><p>Rosmer. Very well. Then I too am under the influence of our unfettered view of life, Rebecca. There is no one that can judge us. And therefore we must be our own judges.</p></div> </div>
