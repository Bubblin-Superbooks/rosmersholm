Now you really must go out, dear—for a long walk—a really long one, do you hear? There is your hat, and there is your stick.</p><p>Rosmer (taking them from her). Thank you. And you won't come too?</p><p>Rebecca. No, no, I can't come now.</p><p>Rosmer. Very well. You are none the less always with me now. (Goes out by the entrance hall. After a moment REBECCA peeps out from behind the door which he has left open. Then she goes to the door on the right, which she opens.)</p><p>Rebecca (in a whisper). Now, Mrs. Helseth. You can let him come in now. (Crosses to the window. A moment later, KROLL comes in from the right. He bows to her silently and formally and keeps his hat in his hand.)</p></div> </div>
