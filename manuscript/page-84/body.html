<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rosmer (almost speechless). What are you saying! I marry—!</p><p>Kroll. That was on a Thursday afternoon. On the Saturday evening she threw herself from the footbridge into the millrace.</p><p>Rosmer. And you never warned us!</p><p>Kroll. Well, you know yourself how constantly she used to say that she was sure she would die before long.</p><p>Rosmer. Yes, I know. But, all the same, you ought to have warned us!</p><p>Kroll. I did think of doing so. But then it was too late.</p><p>Rosmer. But since then, why have you not—? Why have you kept all this to yourself?</p><p>Kroll. What good would it have done for me to come here and add to your pain and distress? Of course I thought the whole thing was merely wild, empty fancy—until yesterday evening.</p></div> </div>
