<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rebecca. For you never really found yourself as long as Beata was Alive—</p><p>Rosmer. Alas, you are right in that.</p><p>Rebecca. When it came about that I was living together with you here, in peace and solitude—when you exchanged all your thoughts with me unreservedly—your every mood, however tender or intimate—then the great change happened in me. Little by little, you understand. Almost imperceptibly—but overwhelmingly in the end, till it reached the uttermost depths of my soul.</p><p>Rosmer. What does this mean, Rebecca?</p><p>Rebecca. All the other feeling—all that horrible passion that had drowned my better self—left me entirely. All the violent emotions that had been roused in me were quelled and silenced. A peace stole over my soul—a quiet like that of one of our mountain peaks up under the midnight sun.</p></div> </div>
