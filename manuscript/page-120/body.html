I—in Beata's place—?</p><p>Rosmer. And then that chapter of my life will be closed—completely closed, never to be reopened.</p><p>Rebecca (in a low, trembling voice). Do you think so, John?</p><p>Rosmer. It must be so! It must! I cannot—I will not—go through life with a dead body on my back. Help me to throw it off, Rebecca; and then let us stifle all memories in our sense of freedom, in joy, in passion. You shall be to me the only wife I have ever had.</p><p>Rebecca (controlling herself). Never speak of this, again. I will never be your wife.</p></div> </div>
